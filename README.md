## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Really didn't enjoy this one, took very long to complete. I am happy how I was able to get the linear gradient looking border for the instagram overview block. And I'm relieved that i managed to get the Light and Dark mode to work as intended. The site is unfortunately not very responsive. Looks good in full sized desktop and mobile exclusively, nothing in between.
